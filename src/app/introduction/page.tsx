        Imagine you have some text that you want inside ~a computer~, such as
        the following:

        All digital information must eventually be stored as a series of{" "}
        <ILCode>0</ILCode>s and <ILCode>1</ILCode>s. This is known as binary,
        with each <ILCode>0</ILCode> or <ILCode>1</ILCode> being a "bit." In
        order to store and display text, we have to somehow convert all of our
        complicated human symbols into binary.

      <Par>
        We call this process <i>encoding</i>. Roughly, we may say encoding is
        "taking information stored in one format, and turning it into another."
        There are essentially an infinite number of ways to do that, and
        computer scientists spend a lot of time arguing about them.

        It's important to recognize that there's a somewhat fundamental obstacle
        with representing things in binaryâ€”there are no spaces to separate
        things! Say for instance you started writing out the alphabet like this,
        counting up in binary:

        This starts to work, for instance if we just see a <ILCode>1</ILCode>{" "}
        that's clearly <ILCode>b</ILCode>, and just a <ILCode>0</ILCode> is{" "}
        <ILCode>a</ILCode>, but what about <ILCode>10</ILCode>? Does that mean{" "}
        <ILCode>ba</ILCode> or <ILCode>c</ILCode>? We aren't allowed to do
        something like <ILCode>1 0 10 = bac</ILCode>, it has to all be in one
        long line like <ILCode>1010</ILCode>.

        This introduces us to two fundamental questions any text encoding must
        answer:
      </Par>
      <ul>
        <li>- Can I represent every letter uniquely?</li>
        <li>- Can I tell where one letter ends and another begins?</li>

        <i>ASCII</i>
        <Aside>"American Standard Code for Information Interchange"</Aside> is a
        simple and widely recognized English text
        <Aside>Latin Alphabet, really.</Aside> encoding that fits these
        requirements. It's old and has some historic quirks, but for now we'll
        pretend it's perfect.

      <Par>
        It solves our problem in the most straightforward way: just make
        everything the exact same size. It turns out that if we use 7 bits per
        character, we can represent all uppercase and lowercase letters, along
        with some important extras like spaces, punctuation, and special
        characters.
      </Par>
      <Par>
        For ~computer science reasons~
        <Aside>
          We like when things are aligned to powers of 2, because it's easy to
          represent powers of 2 in binary.
        </Aside>
        , we usually add another <ILCode>0</ILCode> to the beginning to bring
        this up to a nice even 8 bits. So, to find where one letter begins and
        another ends in our long string of binary, we can simply go forward and
        backward 8 bits and we'll always land on a clean boundary.

        That's it! We've successfully taken some text and converted it to binary
        using ASCII encoding. You're now ready to move on to{" "}
        <StyledLink href="/huffman">Huffman Coding</StyledLink>, which packs
        everything a bit tighter. You can also play around with ASCII by
        changing the text displayed above:
      </Par>
      <input
        type="text"
        value={text ?? ""}
        onChange={(e) => updateText(e.target.value)}
